## Team Contract (jrydin2-reedlb2-rjw7-tfarber3)

### Communication
1. Team Meetings

     Our team will meet once a week every Monday from 5-7 PM using Zoom.
Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with jrydin2. Notes will
be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also
responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the
team at the start of the following week’s meeting.
2. Assistance 

    Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, text, or Slack. Outside
of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails or texts within 48 hours.
3. Respect 

    The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly
meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak
or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project.
All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred,
it is not required. 50/50 votes reuqire more deliberation. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering
to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

### Collaboration

1. Work Distribution 

    Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined
by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When
no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a
paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments
can be made on a case by case basis.
2. Time Commitment

     To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to
independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project.
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist
with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or
programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to
make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked –
politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such
as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team
members.
3. Conflict Resolution

    All conflicts will be resolved by rock, paper, scissors. Standard rules, 3, 2, 1, go, then participants throw their sign. Other games of equal chance are valid so long as they are agreed upon by the participants.

4. Git Branch Management

    Upon starting a coding session, 'git pull origin main' must be run in the terminal. Upon completion of a coding session, a coder must push complete, non bugged code, using 'git push origin *insert personal branch here*'. Upon pushing, the coder must create a pull request to main. If Github detects no merge conflicts, the pull request should be resolved through merging. Otherwise, the coder must discuss the conflicts with the most recent commiter.
