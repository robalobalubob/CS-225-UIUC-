A document with exactly one paragraph per week, describing what was accomplished or attempted in that week. For full credit, your team must add a paragraph to this document every week (starting the week project goals are confirmed). You are strongly encouraged to as a git commit.


Week 1: 11/08/2021
We begna our meeting by introducing ourselves and deciding a project topic. We then wen on to create the proposal and contract. 

Week 2: 11/15/2021
We began our meeting by going over the feedback we received from our project mentor. We then went through some of the changes to the proposal that Tom made over the weekend. We made some small updates to the Data and Aquisition section of our proposal. We then began to discuss how to structure the data within our code and how to build our graph. We plan to use article objects to hold each of the pointers for our adjacency list. Each article object will contain a string representing the current article node, a pointer to an edge object with will  contian a pointer to any further edge objects and a location in an edge list.

Week 3: 11/29/2021
We began to assign a ranking to each algorithm in terms of importance of getting done. We assigned an algorithm to different members, with Robby doing Page Rank and Jae doing Djiktra's. Reed will do BFS. We discussed how the graphs would be formated. We created a basic makefile and a main file. We determined a time to do the mid-project check in on Wednesday from 6:20 to 6:40 . We will be meeting Friday morning at 11am.

Mid-project check-in 12/1/2021
Look at mp_intro for makefile. Deadline is the 13th. Rely mostly on test cases, and for complex stuff at the presentation.

Meeting 4: 12/3/2021
We discussed what what we have determined over the past week. Developing a general outline for how PageRank will work, with the adjacency matrix, taking in the articles and returning the map. From then, we discussed the current plan of deliverables. PageRank will generate a ranking of every matrix and return a possible pathway. BFS will label every edge with either discovery or cross, and return a vector representing the distance from every node to another. Dijkstra's will return a vector containing the names of each link in order of visiting to reach the end optimally. As for the presentation at the end, we decided to create a video and host on youtube, as this creates the opportunity for multiple takes.

Meeting 5: 12/7/2021
We started with a progress report on each portion. Progress of Dijkstra's is in the pseudocode phase, but has a solid idea as to how it works. We then discussed the general setup for the graph, and how it looks in our code. PageRank has been set up with an algorithm, but is rather buggy. It's there, but has errors. BFS has been sort of written, but doesn't have the deliverables it needs to. We committed to having something pushed to the github by Thursday Night, and completed with deliverables by Saturday night, working on the presentation on Sunday. Good luck, folks.

Meeting 6: 12/12/2021
Having completed the executables, we then made the goals.md, results.md, and README.md. We then discussed and decided to leave making the video for about an hour and a half later, to give us time to come up with things to say. In addition, we created executable commands and formatted the files into folders, for ease of use. We also completed the presentation today, wrapping up everything with our project. There may be a few nitpicks here or there, but everything is in place.
